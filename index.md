## About Me

I am a post-doctoral fellow at the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California. Prior to joining USC, I received my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

My current research interests broadly lie in the area of computational fluid dynamics of compressible high speed flows, stability theory, large scale and distributed optimization, stochastic modeling, and uncertainty quantification.
